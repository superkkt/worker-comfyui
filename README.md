---

This project allows you to run ComfyUI workflows as a serverless API endpoint on the RunPod platform. Submit workflows via API calls and receive a completion status after the workflow finishes. Runtime input and output files are transferred through Cloudflare R2.

3.  ⚙️ Optionally configure the worker using environment variables - see the full [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).
4.  🧪 Pick an example workflow from [`test_resources/workflows/`](./test_resources/workflows/) or [get your own](#getting-the-workflow-json).
5.  🚀 Follow the [Usage](#usage) steps below to interact with your deployed endpoint.

## API Specification

The worker exposes standard RunPod serverless endpoints (`/run`, `/runsync`, `/health`). The handler downloads workflow input files from Cloudflare R2 before execution, uploads files written under `/tmp/r2/outputs/` after execution, and returns a success status when the workflow finishes. Generated files are not embedded in the response.

Use the `/runsync` endpoint for synchronous requests that wait for the job to complete and return the result directly. Use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous requests that return immediately with a job ID; you'll need to poll the `/status` endpoint separately to get the result.

### Input

```json
{
  "input": {
    "workflow": {
      "6": {
        "inputs": {
          "text": "a ball on the table",
          "clip": ["30", 1]
        },
        "class_type": "CLIPTextEncode",
        "_meta": {
          "title": "CLIP Text Encode (Positive Prompt)"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following tables describe the fields within the `input` object:

| Field Path                | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`                   | Object | Yes      | Top-level object containing request data.                                                                                     |
| `input.workflow`          | Object | Yes      | The ComfyUI workflow exported in the [required format](#getting-the-workflow-json).                                           |
| `input.comfy_org_api_key` | String | No       | Optional per-request Comfy.org API key for API Nodes. Overrides the `COMFY_ORG_API_KEY` environment variable if both are set. |

#### R2 File Paths

The request must not include file bodies. Upload input files to the configured R2 bucket before calling the endpoint, then reference them in the workflow with `/tmp/r2/inputs/...` paths.

| Workflow Local Path                  | R2 Object Key           | Direction |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------- |
| `/tmp/r2/inputs/source/input.png`    | `source/input.png`      | Download before workflow execution |
| `/tmp/r2/outputs/result/image.png`   | `result/image.png`      | Upload after workflow execution |

Rules:

- Input file paths must start with `/tmp/r2/inputs/`.
- Output file paths must start with `/tmp/r2/outputs/`.
- Paths containing `..` are rejected.
- `input.images` is no longer supported; files must be passed through R2.

### Output

```json
{
  "id": "sync-uuid-string",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "output": {
    "status": "success"
  },
  "delayTime": 123,
  "executionTime": 4567
}
```

| Field Path      | Type   | Required | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output`        | Object | Yes      | Top-level object containing the result of the job execution.  |
| `output.status` | String | Yes      | `"success"` when ComfyUI reports that the workflow completed. |

Generated files are uploaded to the configured R2 bucket using paths relative to `/tmp/r2/outputs/`. The handler does not base64-encode files or include file URLs in the response.

## Usage

To interact with your deployed RunPod endpoint:

1.  **Get API Key:** Generate a key in RunPod [User Settings](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/settings) (`API Keys` section).
2.  **Get Endpoint ID:** Find your endpoint ID on the [Serverless Endpoints](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/endpoints) page or on the `Overview` page of your endpoint.

### Generate Image (Sync Example)

Send a workflow to the `/runsync` endpoint (waits for completion). Replace `<api_key>` and `<endpoint_id>`. The `-d` value should contain the [JSON input described above](#input).

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"workflow":{... your workflow JSON ...}}}' \
  https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/runsync
```

You can also use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous jobs and then poll the `/status` to see when the job is done. Or you [add a `webhook` into your request](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/send-requests#webhook-notifications) to be notified when the job is done.

Refer to [`test_input.json`](./test_input.json) for a complete input example.

## Getting the Workflow JSON

To get the correct `workflow` JSON for the API:

1.  Open ComfyUI in your browser.
2.  In the top navigation, select `Workflow > Export (API)`
3.  A `workflow.json` file will be downloaded. Use the content of this file as the value for the `input.workflow` field in your API requests.

## SSH Access

To enable SSH access to the worker, set the `PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable to your SSH public key. The worker will start an SSH server automatically. Make sure to expose **port 22** in your RunPod template so you can connect.
